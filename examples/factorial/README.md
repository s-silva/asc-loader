# Factorial Example

This example demonstrates how to setup a basic add function, import a JavaScript function and setup a factorial function using ASC-Loader.

## Setup

You can copy the contents of this folder to a different location or set this up right here.

```bash
# npm
npm i

# yarn
yarn
```

## Running in DEV Mode

```bash
# npm
npm start

# yarn
yarn start
```

## Building in Production Mode

```bash
# npm
npm build

# yarn
yarn build
```

## Running Production Build Using Python

This is just here to demonstrate how to run it using SimpleHTTPServer, since older versions of Python do not have the necessary MIME types to recognize WASM files.

```bash
python server.py
```
